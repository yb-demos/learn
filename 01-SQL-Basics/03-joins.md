For detailed information concerning JOINs, please refer to the official [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

To start, make sure you have all the necessary [prerequisites](https://github.com/Yugabyte/yugabyte-db/wiki/YSQL-Tutorial:-Prerequisites) and have logged into the YSQL shell.fetch
